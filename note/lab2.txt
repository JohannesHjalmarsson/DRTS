# Lab 2


## Step 1: The Brother John player – the design

The following design decisions were made in order to implement the music player, here driven by a new class called MelGen.

 - Make new melody generator class MelGen that uses 32-bit arrays to read and play Brother John melody using a ToneGen
 - Use half beats as the unit of time rather than bmp internally, and translate bpm to half beats in the set tempo method
 - The "main loop" method of the MelGen class is a scheduler function that uses the SEND function to TONE_PLAY and TONE_STOP the tone generator in accordance with the beat as well as TONE_PERIOD_SET to set the key/tone
 - Extend the functionaly of the tone generator to support a mute function (multiply output with mute)
 - Repurpose the application.c integer input code from Lab0

Problem 1a. See timing diagram.

Problem 1b. See access graph.

Problem 2. NOTE: Not tested.


## Step 3: Yes, we CAN!
